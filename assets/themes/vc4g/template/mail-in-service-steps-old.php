        <p>Vancouver Cash for Gold established its mail-in program as a safe and viable alternative to those risky “cash for gold” operations that force unsuspecting consumers to accept unfair rates and shoddy, second class service. We take pride in our service commitment, whether you visit one of our locations or mail in your items – each and every client is treated with the utmost care and consideration. As gold buying specialists, we have gained the trust of thousands of customers and clients and can offer this secure, high end alternative to the usual mail-in service.
